# Announcement Guide: diff-biophys

This document outlines the strategy and drafted verbiage for announcing **DiffBiophys** on Twitter (X) and Reddit.

Because `diff-biophys` is a highly technical, JAX-based library targeting researchers, the messaging focuses on **differentiability, gradient descent optimization, and physics-informed AI**.

## 🐦 Twitter (X) Strategy: The "AI for Science" Hook

**Target Audience:** AI/ML Researchers, Structural Biologists, JAX Enthusiasts.
**Goal:** High engagement through visuals and highlighting the "missing link" between structures and experimental data.

### Option 1: The Visual Demo (Recommended)
*Requires a GIF or short video showing a structure moving to fit a SAXS/NMR curve.*

**Draft Tweet:**
> AlphaFold gives us static structures, but biology happens in solution. 🧬
>
> Introducing DiffBiophys: A hardware-accelerated, differentiable biophysics engine built in JAX.
>
> Optimize protein models directly against experimental SAXS and NMR data using gradient descent. 📉

## 👽 Reddit Strategy: Focused Subreddits

### 1. r/MachineLearning & r/learnmachinelearning
**Tag:** `[P]` (Project)
**Title:** [P] DiffBiophys: Differentiable SAXS & NMR kernels in JAX for physics-informed protein AI

**Post Content:**
Hi everyone,

I’ve released **DiffBiophys**, a high-performance Python library built on **JAX** that re-implements core structural biology observables (SAXS, NMR) as hardware-accelerated, auto-differentiable kernels.

**The Problem:**
We have amazing structure prediction models (AlphaFold, ESMFold), but fitting these models or training new architectures against real-world, solution-state experimental data (like X-ray scattering) is computationally expensive and traditionally non-differentiable.

**The Solution:**
DiffBiophys provides a "differentiable bridge." Because everything is written in JAX, you can:
1. **Optimize** protein structures directly against experimental spectra via gradient descent (no massive MD simulations needed).
2. **Train** GNNs or Diffusion models using physics-informed loss functions (e.g., penalize a model if its predicted structure doesn't match a known SAXS curve).
3. **Accelerate** large-scale biophysical simulations on GPUs and TPUs.

**Features:**
*   Differentiable NeRF (Internal to Cartesian coordinates)
*   $O(N^2)$ Debye Formula for SAXS (GPU-optimized)
*   Differentiable NMR observables

**Links:**
*   **GitHub:** [Link to Repo]
*   **Use Cases & Docs:** [Link to Docs]

Would love to hear thoughts from anyone working at the intersection of AI and structural biology!

### 2. r/bioinformatics & r/StructuralBiology
**Title:** [Tool] DiffBiophys: Gradient-based structure refinement against SAXS and NMR data (built in JAX)

**Post Content:**
Hi everyone,

I've been working on **DiffBiophys**, a new tool designed to bridge the gap between static structural models and experimental solution-state data.

If you've ever wanted to subtly refine a predicted structure (or an ensemble) to better fit a SAXS curve or NMR data, DiffBiophys allows you to do this directly using gradient descent.

**Key Features:**
*   **Differentiable Physics:** Calculates SAXS and NMR observables in a way that allows gradients to backpropagate directly to the atomic coordinates or backbone torsions.
*   **Hardware Accelerated:** Built on JAX, so it runs incredibly fast on GPUs/TPUs compared to traditional CPU-bound tools.
*   **Pythonic API:** Designed to integrate easily into existing Python data pipelines or Jupyter notebooks.

**Get Started:**
`pip install diff-biophys`

**Links:**
*   **GitHub:** [Link to Repo]
*   **Documentation & Tutorials:** [Link to Docs]

I'm currently looking for feedback on the API and any specific observables you'd like to see added next!

### 3. r/JAX
**Title:** I built a differentiable biophysics engine for structural biology entirely in JAX

**Post Content:**
Hey r/JAX,

I wanted to share a domain-specific application of JAX I've been working on: **DiffBiophys**.

It implements core structural biology calculations (like the Debye formula for X-ray scattering and spatial coordinate transforms like NeRF) as auto-differentiable, `jit`-compilable kernels.

This allows researchers to optimize 3D protein structures against experimental data using gradient-based optimizers (like Optax) instead of relying on stochastic sampling or rigid-body fitting.

It was a great experience translating traditional $O(N^2)$ biophysics algorithms into vectorized JAX primitives. If you're interested in AI for Science or just want to see some applied JAX code, check out the repo!

## 📈 Pre-Launch Checklist
1. **Polish the "Use Cases":** Ensure the docs have at least one compelling Google Colab notebook demonstrating a gradient descent optimization.
2. **Create a Visual:** Generate a GIF or plot comparing a "Before Optimization" and "After Optimization" fit for a SAXS curve.
3. **Check the Build:** Ensure `pip install diff-biophys` works cleanly on a fresh environment.
